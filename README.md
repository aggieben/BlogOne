This is a simple blogging engine.  It will improve over time and will get new features occasionally, but it will always be focused on the single-user, developer-centric use case.  It exists because I got tired of using WordPress, and because I wanted to be able to experiment.

It is an ASP.NET MVC 5 application which also uses a handful of other bits, most of which can be found on GitHub:
